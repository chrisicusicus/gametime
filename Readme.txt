Shroomies (ver 2/5/23)

Important!: This game requires cookies to play.  You must close the tab to restart the Shroomies inventory.

Desc: "You wake up on the side of the road by the woods.  There are two paths.  Which one do you take?"
I originally started this project with a lot of ideas, and I knew at the time they were too many for me to do in the time frame I had.
Your goal is to find all the Shroomies.  There are currently 2 in the game.
Once you've collected all the Shroomies, the door will be accessible for you to end the game.

Issues: sessionStorage is quite new to me so this was a tricky one, and I still have not managed to master it.
I would like to get to the point where I can relay the sessionStorage on the camp1 and campsite pages correctly.
I would also like to get to the point where there is a total of 9 Shroomies to be collected.
Each Shroomie will have a description and a concept.  I also have a lot of script that I did not have time to code.
I'm looking forward to continuing this project in the near future.

Thank you for playing!

Also thank you to Ben for helping me remember that buttons are thing. :)
